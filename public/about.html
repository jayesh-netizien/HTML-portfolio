<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Hi, I'm Jayesh lale</h2>

<p>

  I'm a pre-final year undergrad student at Indian Institute of Information Technology, Nagpur.
  Currently in Sem V and pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering.

 
</p>
  I'm so delighted by the truth that i'll able to develop website as a side hobby,
  and also would be earning money on the mainstream, thanks to Dr. Angela yu who 
  inspired me as i got into this.
<p>
  My personal hobbies:
  <ul>
    <li> Football </li>
    <li> Chess </li>
    <li> Watching Web series and movies </li>
    <li> learning about new tech and unlocking new abilities </li>
    <li> Solo travel </li>
    <li> Novel reading too </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  Future goals:
  I wanna pursue computer science and engineering as a profession.
  It has been an area of interest since my childhood but i got even 
  more serious about it when got into uni, as i couldn't pursue majors
  in this stream i've delayed getting into the actual deal.

    I will soon be immigrating to USA for further studies after my undergrad,
    and would be spending some time in India to get financially sound.
